        - **The Dataset**  
            - The dataset items were collected from several hospitals and medical centers in Sudan.   
            - The hospitalreport includes the patient number, age, sex, CT, MRI diagnoses, and other variables for all patients hospitalized in the hospitals participated in the study. 
            - The data used in the dataset include the data of patient of cases from 2013 to 2015.
            - The dataset contains 400 patients; their age is mainly between 50 and 88 years. A few cases in the age of 33 years and most of them are male.<br/>

   2. **Classification of stroke disease using machine learning algorithms**
         - **Date**
            - 2019
            
        - **The Dataset**  
            - The data were collected in the form of patient case sheets from Sugam Multispecialty Hospital, India.
            - The case sheets contained information from over 507 stroke patients ranging from 35 to 90 years of age.
            - A total of 22 unique class labels related to stroke were identified that fell under two major stroke types: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.<br/><br/>

        - **Conclusion** 
            - The categories of SVM and ensemble (bagged) provided 91% accuracy with 0.0000 negative predictive value.
            - ANN trained with the stochastic gradient descent algorithm outperformed other algorithms, with a higher classification accuracy [ 95% with a lower standard deviation of 14.69.
            - This study indicates that stroke is more prevalent in men than in women and in the age group from 40 to 60 years old.
