        - **The Dataset**  
            - (ATLAS) Dataset
              - The dataset contained 229 T1-weighted MRI images suffered from stroke. 210 abnormal images and 210 normal images. 
               - Then labelled normal patient images as 0 and abnormal patient images as 1 for classification.<br/>

        - **Conclusion** 
            - The research experimental results show that these deep neural networks are absolutely relevant to brain stroke diagnosis.
            - Therefore, the accuracy got on proposed method is better than traditional machine learning methods.
