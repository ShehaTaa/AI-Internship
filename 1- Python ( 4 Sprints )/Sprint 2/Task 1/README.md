# 1- What ’re the methods that you used ?

  1. **print()** method
  
  2. - input()
     - strip()
     - range()
   
  3. Floor division


# 2- Explain each method ..
  
  1. Just print message
  
  2. Use **if else** statment to check specific condition on user input<br /> 
     - use **input** method to receive input from user<br /> 
     - use **strip** method to string with both leading and trailing characters stripped<br /> 
     - use **int** method to cast string input to integer<br /> 
     
  3. Use Arithmetic Operators to make :-<br />   
     - Summation
     - Subtract
     - multiplication
     
  4. Use **Division :-**<br />
     - Floating point division --> **/** <br />
     - Floor division --> **//** <br />
     - 5 / 2  = 2.5 <br />
     -  5 // 2 = 2 
     
  5. Use **Loops :-**<br />
      - Reads integer,n ,from user.<br />
      - For all non-negative integers i < n , print i * i
      
  6. Read an integer,n ,and print 1 .. n Without using any string method in one line without spaces.
  
  7. Cheak **leap year :-**<br />
      - An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day.<br />
      - It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.<br />
      - In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:<br />
        - The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:<br />
           - The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:<br />
              - The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
