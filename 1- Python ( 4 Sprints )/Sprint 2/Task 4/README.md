# 1- What ’re the methods that you used ?

   1. set()

   2. **Set operations :-**
        - discard()
        - remove()
        - pop()
        - union()
        - intersection()
        - difference()
        - symmetric_difference()
        - update()
        - intersection_update()
        - difference_update()
        - symmetric_difference_update()  
        - add()
        - issubset()
        - issuperset()
        - 
   3. strip()

   4. split()


# 2- Explain each method ..
   
   1. Calculate average of set items:- 
         1. sum set items
         2. div by length of set

   2. Calculate **Symmetric Difference** between two sets<br />
      using symmetric_difference method.

   3. count unique items in set

   4. Make some opertaions on set using
        - discard
        - remove
        - pop 
      then calculate sum of rest of set items

   5. calculate union of two sets

   6. calculate intersection of two sets 

   7. calculate difference of two sets

   8. calculate symmetric difference of two sets

   9. Using set mutations methods to do some set operations
        - update()
        - intersection_update()
        - difference_update()
        - symmetric_difference_update() 

   10. Select Captain's unique room among hotel rooms
         - define two empty sets.
         - loop for all rooms, then check.
             - if room not in set 1. 
                    then add this room to the two sets.
             - else discard this room from set two.     

   11. Check if set a is supset from another set b

   12. check if set a is superset to another set b 

   13. - gain points if i find items belong to set i like<br />
       - loss points if i find items belong to set i dislike.<br />
       - define set a and set b and list of items
           - if i find items belong to set a that i like
               - increase points by 1
           - if i find items belong to set b that i dislike
               - decrese points by 1
       - then calculate final result
