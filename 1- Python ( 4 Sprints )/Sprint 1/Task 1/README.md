# 1- What ’re the methods that you used ?
   ### basic methods of python
     
   * **str :-**<br />
       to rturn string of integer number
     
   * **int :-**<br />
       to convert string number to integer and sum them
     
   * **len :-**<br />
       to get length of number and if to check custom condition
     
   * **% :-**<br />
       to check if number is odd or not by reminder
     
   * **range :-**<br />
       to get numbers between this range
     
   * **recursion :-**<br />
       to calculate facturial of number
     
   * **"%s - String formating" :-**<br />
       Use it if the order of your arguments is not likely to change<br />
       and you only have very few elements you want to concatenate.

# 2- Explain each method ..
   1. **sum_num :-**<br />
        Sum two numbers
        
   2. **square_of_num :-**<br />
        Calc square of number
        
   3. **int_to_str :-**<br />
        Convert intger to string
       
   4. **calc_sum_of_str :-**<br />
        Convert strings to numbers and sum them
       
   5. **concat_str :-**<br />
        Concatenate strings
        
   6. **calc_len_of_str :-**<br />
        Calculate length of strings and compare them
        
   7. **check_even_odd :-**<br />
        Check if unmber is even or odd
        
   8. **check_str :-**<br />
        Check if given str like condition
        
   9. Find all numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200<br />
   
   10. **fact_of_num :-**<br />
        Calc factorial of number by recursion 
        
   11. **calc_eque :-**<br />
         - Is to build a method to compute the value of a+aa+aaa+aaaa with a given digit as the value of a
         - So, I have used the %s operator which is most often used in conjunction with the % operator for strings
