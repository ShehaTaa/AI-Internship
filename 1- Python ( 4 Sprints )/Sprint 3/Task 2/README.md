        - Counter()
           - most_common()
        - defaultdict()
        - namedtuple()
        - OrderedDict()

# 2- Explain each method ..

   1. - you have shoe shop, and shop has X number of shoes.
         - use Counter to count number of occurance of each item x.
         - calculate how much money you earned from customer.

   2. - Have number of word in group A and number of words in group B.
         - Using defaultdict, check whether the word of B has appeared in group A or not.
         - and print where they appear.

   3. - Have a spreadsheet containing a list of student's ID, marks, class and name.
         - Calculate the average marks of the students Using namedTuple.

   4. - Have collection of items
         - each item have it's name, price, and number of purchas.
         - Using OrderedDict to print each item_name and net_price in order of its first occurrence.

   5. - Given some words
         - print number of distinct words
         - print number of occurance of each word using OrderedDict

   6. Perform some deque operations like:-
         - append()
         - pop() 
         - popleft()

   7. Using deque to rearrange items in deque with some conditions

   8. make logo for a compane by it's most 3 occuarnce chars in it's name 
         - using Counter()
