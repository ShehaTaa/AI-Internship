   - **Lesson 9 (Probability):-**
        - Basic of probability
        - Some basic probability rules as:-
          - Probability of event is the division of it by total events
          - Sum probability is always 1   
          - Probability of opposit event P(A) = 1 - P(~A)
          - Probability of composit independence event P(A1).P(A2). ...

   - **Lesson 10 (Conditional Probability):-**
        - Conditional Probability is dependent probability 
        - P(A|B) = P(B|A).P(A) / P(B)
        - Total Probability = P(A | B).P(B) + P(A | ~B).P(~B)
