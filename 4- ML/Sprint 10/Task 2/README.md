   - **Machine Learning**
       - The Study of computer programs (Algorithms) that can learn by example.
       
       - Machine Learning models learn from experience as:
         1. Labeled examples
         2. User feedback
         3. Surrounding environment as self-driving cars
         
       - Machine Learning brings many fields together as
         1. Statistics
         2. Computer Science
         3. Economics
         4. Biology
         5. Psychology  
         
       - Machine Learning is being used in many applicatios as 
         1. Fraud Detection
         2. Speech Recognition
         3. Object Detection and Tracking
         4. Medical fields
            - Disease Classification and Detection
         5. Self-driving cars
         
       - Machine Learning Types
       
         1. Supervised Learning
            - Learn to predict target values from labelled data 
              1. Classification : discrete class
              2. Regression : continuous values
         2. Unsupervised Learning  
            - Find structure in unlabeled data
              1. Clustring
              2. Outlier detection
              3. Dimensionality Reduction  
              
       - Machine Learning Workflow
         1. Representation
            - feature representations
            - Type of classifier to use
         2. Evaluation
            - What criterion to use
         3. Optimization
            - Tune hyper-parameters     
            
       - Python Tools for Machine Learning
         - scikit-learn
           - Support a very side array of important machine learning algorithms.
         - Scipy
           - Support data manipulation and analysis methods.
         - Numpy
           - Support fundmental data structures and arrays.
         - pandas
           - Support data manipulation and analysis. 
           - Support reading and writing data in a variety of formats.   
         - matplotlib 
           - Using for plotting graphs    
                       
       - Examining the data is important for:
         1. Inspecting feature values
         2. Inspecting missing values or noisy data
         3. Understand the porblem
         
       - K-Nearest Neighbors Classification **K-NN**  
         - Can be used for classification and regression.
         - It's a memory-based supervised learning.
         - **K** in K-NN refers to the number of nearest neighbors the classifier will retrieve and use in order to make a prediction.
         - **K-NN Steps**:-
             1. we need to choose the value of K, the nearest data points. K can be any integer.
             2. Calculate the distance between test data and each row of training data using Euclidean, Manhattan or Hamming distance.
                2.1 based on the distance value, sort them in ascending order.
                2.2 It will choose the top K rows from the sorted array.
                2.3 It will assign a class to the test point based on most frequent class of these rows.
